# General - Release Policy

This document will walk you through the release policy for __nscale__.

## Overview
__nscale__ is a young project and it is going through fast iterations. We are currently in version
range `0.x` and it will stay in `0.x` up until it is needed. We will update this document in a timely
fashion. We plan to release updates on a __weekly basis__, and use github issues to track the process.

## Semantic Versioning

The __nscale__ project follows [Semantic Versioning][SemVer], which means that given a version
number in the format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` we increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

__nscale__ is currently on version `0.x` which means we may change the API and the commands as needed to
evolve the project. If you are worried about backward compatibility, get in touch via email at
___nscale@nearform.com___. We can support you through the various updates and provide professional suport.

## Changes and Release Notes

We commit to maintaining a [CHANGELOG][ChangeLog] which will be updated with each and every release,
regardless of the type of change it is. This file will contain a summarised list of changes and release notes
along with links back to any issues if applicable.
