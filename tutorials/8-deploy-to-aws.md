Deploying on AWS
================
[Previous](./7-using-docker-images.md) | [Home](./)

This tutorial covers:

1. Installing nscale on an EC2 instance
2. AWS configuration file updates
3. Deployment into AWS
4. Check and fix on AWS

During this tutorial we will assume deployment onto a linux based AMI. Specifically we assume use of ubuntu as the base operating system.

Installing nscale on AWS
------------------------
nscale should be installed on AWS in a similar manner to a direct linux install:

* boot up a community base VM. Do this using the ubuntu [EC2 AMI locator](http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/). We recommend using a 64 bit Trusty image.

* connect to your newly booted VM and install docker as per the instructions [here](http://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/)

* add yourself to the docker group using:
```bash
$sudo usermod -G docker -a $(whoami)
```
For these changes to come into effect you usually need to log out and log back in.
close the ssh connection with your instance with ```exit``` and reconnect.

* It is recommended you install the build-essentials package. Many default AMIs do not come with packages such as make and g++. This will ensure you have the packages required for some npm modules to work. Failing to do so may lead to problems installing nscale depending on the AMI you launched.

	`$sudo apt-get install build-essential`

* Check out our [document](../setup-guides/install-node.md) which outlines our favourite ways of installing node.

* Install git and configure:
    * git config --global user.name "your name"
    * git config --global user.email "you@somewhere.com"

Enable SSH Agent Forwarding
----------------------------
create a file `config` in the ~/.ssh folder on your local machine and insert the following:
```
host *
 ForwardAgent yes
```
This allows the remote instance to use your local ssh key for cloning Github repos. You may need to log out and back in to see the effect of this.

Once the above dependencies have been met you can proceed to install nscale using 
```bash
$npm install -g nscale
```

Lastly you must copy the private key file used for connecting to the instance onto the instance itself.
The private key will be used by nscale for connecting to other remote instances it creates.

Recommended
----------------------
To make life easier, there is a powerful tool called SSHFS which allows you to mount a remote file system locally via ssh. This lets you view files on your remote instance in your file browser and you'll be able to edit them using graphical editors. Check out the guide to using it [here](http://www.emreakkas.com/linux-tips/how-to-mount-amazon-ec2-drive-locally-fuse-sshfs)

Configuring AMIs for use with nscale
------------------------------------
A base AMI configured for management by nscale should be created. We can just create a reusable image based off our newly configured instance as per above. An easy way to do this is through the EC2 Dashboard:

* Find the instance you've just set up and right click.
* Image > Create Image.
* Follow the steps provided.

See [here.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ApiReference-cmd-CreateImage.html) if you would prefer to use the AWS Command Line Interface tools.   

Once the server has been imaged, make a note of the ami identifier and log back into the running management system.

AWS configuration file updates
------------------------------
In order to operate correctly on AWS the nscale coniguration file (~/.nscale/config/config.json) requires some additional parameters. These are as follows:

* Kernel section
  * user - the username to use when connecting to remove systems (ubuntu)
  * identityFile - the full path to the ssh key file required to connect to remote systmes
  * region - the AWS region you are using
  * accessKeyId - your AWS API access key
  * secretAccessKey- your AWS secret access key
* Modules section
  * analysis section
    * set the analyzer to - nscale-aws-analyzer
  * Containers section
    * add aws-elb-container - specifiy the default subnet and vpc ID
    * add aws-sg-container - specifiy the default subnet and vpc ID
    * add aws-ami-container - specifiy the default subnet and vpc ID and also the ami id 

A full AWS confiuration file should look similar to the following:

```js
{
  "kernel": {
    "port": "8010",
    "root": "/home/ubuntu/.nscale",
    "user": "ubuntu",
    "identityFile": "FULL_PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY.pem",
    "region": "us-west-2",
    "accessKeyId": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "secretAccessKey": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  },
  "api": {
  },
  "web": {
  },
  "modules": {
    "protocol": {
      "require": "nscale-protocol",
      "specific": {
      }
    },
    "authorization": {
      "require": "nscale-noauth",
      "specific": {
        "credentialsPath": "/home/ubuntu/.nscale/data"
      }
    },
    "analysis": {
      "require": "nscale-aws-analyzer",
      "specific": {
      }
    }
  },
  "containers": [{
    "require": "aws-elb-container",
    "type": "aws-elb",
    "specific": {
      "region": "us-west-2",
      "defaultSubnetId": "subnet-xxxxxxxx",
      "defaultVpcId": "vpc-xxxxxxxx"
      }
  },
  {
    "require": "aws-sg-container",
    "type": "aws-sg",
      "specific": {
      "region": "us-west-2",
      "defaultSubnetId": "subnet-xxxxxxxx",
      "defaultVpcId": "vpc-xxxxxxxx"
    }
  },
  {
    "require": "aws-ami-container",
    "type": "aws-ami",
    "specific": {
      "region": "us-west-2",
      "defaultImageId": "ami-xxxxxxxx",
      "defaultSubnetId": "subnet-xxxxxxxx",
      "defaultVpcId": "vpc-xxxxxxxx"
    }
  },
  {
    "require": "blank-container",
    "type": "blank-container",
    "specific": {}
  },
  {
    "require": "docker-container",
    "type": "docker",
    "specific": {
      "imageCachePath": "/tmp"
    }
  },
  {
    "require": "process-container",
    "type": "process",
    "specific": {}
  }]
}
```

Deploying into AWS
------------------
Now that we have configured our AWS setup lets proceed to deploy a system into AWS. To do this we will clone and deploy the startup death clock.

Lets get started by cloning the repository onto our AWS management system. Firstly cd into a working folder lets say /home/ubuntu/work/sudc.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:nearform/sudc-system.git
nscale system link sudc-system
```
####Infrastructure
nscale compiles from all .js files under the services folder so we can logically organise our container definitions any way we want.
The aws specific definitions are in the awsInfrastructure.js file

it defines three containers:

 * awsWebElb - elastic load balancer definition
 * awsWebSg - security group definition
 * awsMachine - base AMI definition

####Topology
in system.js we can define as many topologies as we want. Each topology is given its own target name e.g. development, process or aws. The aws topology is as follows:

```
  aws: {
    awsWebElb: [{
      awsWebSg:[{awsMachine: ['web']},
                {awsMachine: ['doc', 'hist', 'real']}]
    }]
  },
```

The topology section defines how the service containers are distributed amongst machine instances.

####Edit
In order to make this work we need to make some minor adjustments to the ids specified in the ```awsInfrastructure.js``` file:

Open the file definitions/awsInfrastructure
  * under awsWebElb change the AvailabilityZone setting to match your availability zone
  * under awsWebSg change the VpcId setting to match your VPC
  * under awsMachine change the ImageId to match your ami id



####Compile

Lets now go ahead and compile for aws
```bash
nscale system compile sudc aws
```
Now let's take a look at the system definition:
```bash
nscale container list sudc
```
You should see the following containers:
```bash
awsWebElb            aws-elb              awsWebElb                                         
awsWebSg             aws-sg               awsWebSg                                          
demo2                aws-ami              awsMachine                                        
doc                  process              doc$77c4014bef47deb4fef3af579f2959457c058ce8      
hist                 process              hist$39f0c71b89f3ba78064468c0af79017927f1a6cb     
real                 process              real$5309ad7aeba319fd44adb18bbc983f4587f16af9     
web                  process              web$e2021682ad1d25287321a4883535252ba684d9ba      
root                 blank-container      root 
```
####Build the system
Let's go ahead and build the containers ready for deployment:
```bash
nscale container buildall sudc latest aws
```
Alternatively, you can build all the containers by themselves:

	nscale container build sudc hist latest aws
	nscale container build sudc real latest aws
	nscale container build sudc doc latest aws
	nscale container build sudc web latest aws

After those have all completed we should have four containers ready for deployment.

####Deploy the system
Now that we have an AWS system definintion and a set of containers to deploy, we can go ahead and push our system out onto AWS. 

Lets first run a preview:
```bash
nscale revision preview sudc latest aws
```
This will run an analysis against your configured AWS region and may take several seconds to complete. The preview should determine that a full deployment is required. nscale will show you a list of commands that will be executed against your infrastrcutre upon deployment. You should review this list to ensure that you are comfortable with the changes. If you are lets not go ahead and deploy.
```bash
nscale revision deploy sudc latest aws
```
nscale will no go ahead and deploy the SUDC system into your infrastructure. The following actions will be taken:

* create a new load balancer awsWebElb
* create a new security group awsWebSg
* spin up two machine instances
* deploy front end container to one of the machine instances and start it
* deploy 3 service containers to the other machine instnace and start them

Deployment may take several minutes depending on AWS machine instance spin up time. Once complete you should be able to point a web browser at port 8000 on the front end instance and view the startup death clock front end.

Check and Fix on AWS
--------------------
Now that we have a deployed working system on AWS, lets just check that everything is in order by running an nscale check:
```bash
nscale system check sudc aws
```
The check command will run an analysis against the deployed system and compare it to your desired system configuration. This may take a few moments to run, but nscale should now respond that all is well with your deployment. Lets break something!

Go into the AWS management console and kill the SUDC front end machine. Now run the check again on the management host:
```bash
nscale system check sudc aws
```
This time nscale should report that the system is broked and present a remedial action plan. To go ahead and fix the system execute:
```bash
nscale system fix sudc aws
```
nscale will now boot up a replacement machine and deploy the appropriate containers to it, onece the fix has completed double check it by running:
```bash
nscale system check sudc aws
```
Congratulations - you are now an nscale AWS ninja!
